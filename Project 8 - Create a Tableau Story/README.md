# Project 8 - Create a Tableau Story
For this project, I had to create a data visualization using `Tableau` that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. The work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication. I used US Air Traffic Data for the last 10 years (from 2008 - 2018) from the US - Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
