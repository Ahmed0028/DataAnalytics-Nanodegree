In this project, we investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect).<br>
 We will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task. We will look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and compute some statistics describing the results. Finally,we interpret the results in terms of the selected hypotheses.
